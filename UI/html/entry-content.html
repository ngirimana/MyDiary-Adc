          <h2><span>Title: </span> My reflections on Andela EPIC’s value</h2>
          <p>Written on: 25/09/2019</p>
        </div>
        <span id="content-paragraphs">
          <p>Have you ever wondered why Andela is the best working community in Africa? Well, I am going to share
            Andela’s EPIC
            values which all andelans have. First of all, EPIC stands for Excellence Passion Integrity Collaboration.
            Let us go
            through each letter in this acronym to understand the values which the Andelan community is based on.</p>
          <p>
            Excellence: When we say excellence for all andelans, it means that every andelan has an ambition which is to
            grow every
            day. Owning this value of excellence, all andelans are able to provide the best quality output. For
            andelans, being
            excellent is demonstrated in the following ways: before starting any sort of work, they first prepare their
            minds and
            prepare required tools so as to provide the best possible output. When an Andelan faces a blocker, he or she
            tries his
            best to solve the issue which sometimes requires seeking for help.
          </p>
          <p>
            Andela community members believe that nothing is impossible which means that they are self-motivated. They
            also believe
            that where others say it is impossible, it is possible as long as you seek help and own your own learning.
            They believe
            that if they dream it, they have to make it a reality. Also, their excellence is shown by solving problems
            which benefit
            others. Andelans believe that if you believe in excellence as a value, actions talk louder than words. Work
            hard and
            learn so that you can be able to help others out. Doing more than what is expected, take initiative, use all
            possible
            resources available to solve any blocker and use the time available efficiently and you have a bright future
            ahead of
            you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Passion: for all andelans, passion means doing what you love which means that they have to be passionate
            which goes hand
            in hand with being committed which is needed to achieve a lot in life. Being passionate means that you have
            to
            persistent where others have given up. In addition, every Andela community member believes that meeting a
            blocker
            increases his/her chances of success because it helps them to learn new things as a way of overcoming it.
            Having this
            value for all andelans helps them to set measures for keeping advancing where they fill like they are going
            to give up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Integrity: In Andela, integrity means that they choose the right people to do the right things. Integrity in
            andelea’s
            values is anything that is more essential for them because it is bidirectional which means that every
            andelan should
            hold himself or herself and others accountable as others hold him accountable. All andeleans meant with a
            blocker should
            be open to others to ask them help and when they fail, they own it, learn from it and try their best to
            overcome
            failure. All andelans believe that integrity can be built and can be destroyed at any time and they should
            be kind,
            honest and authentic in society.
          </p>
          <p>
            Collaboration: For andelans, collaboration means that their sum is greater than their parts. This value is
            very
            important in Andela because when one member gets stuck to anything, others are ready to offer help. In
            addition, these
            values lead to working in a team where every team member has a task to be accomplished, collaboration is
            applied here
            because if a team has a big task, they have to divide it into the small task and assign to every team
            member. Teams
            should be sure that every team member is working on his task and if he meets with a blocker, he can ask help
            from other
            teammates in order to complete the task with the right quality at the right time.
